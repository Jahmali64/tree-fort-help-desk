As an administrator of an organization, you will also have the ability to create and manage suborganizations, which are a way to arrange your organization into smaller subunits. You may decide to divide your organization into suborganizations based on teams within an organization, based on jurisdictional differences, or for any other reason. Suborganizations allow for separate user management and separation for accounting and invoicing purposes.

**Note:** if you are an administrator for a suborganization, you will not have the ability to create or manage suborganizations. Administrators for suborganizations can only manage their own suborganization settings and users for their suborganization.

## Managing Suborganizations

To manage your suborganizations, navigate to your **Administrative Settings** option and select **Manage Sub Organizations**, as shown below.

You will be directed to the following page, where you can view all suborganizations.

From this page, you will be able to view and edit all existing suborganizations, as well as create new suborganizations. Both of these options are covered in the next sections of this article.

### Creating a Suborganization

To create a new suborganization, select the **+ Add Sub Organization** button, as shown below.

**Note:** the fields on this page are described in the [Managing Organization Settings](/docs/managing-your-organization/managing-organization-settings/) article.

Once you have entered the required information, select **Save** to create the new suborganization. Once created, new users can be added to the suborganization. More information on managing users can be found [here](/docs/managing-your-organization/managing-users).

### Editing a Suborganization

To edit an existing suborganization, select the **edit** icon beside the suborganization you want to edit, and select the **Edit** option from the dropdown, as shown below.
