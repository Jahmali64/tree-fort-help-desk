### Finding Your TreeFort Administrator
If you do not already have an account in the TreeFort portal, you will have to contact a TreeFort administrator at your organization who has permission to create new users. There may be one or more TreeFort administrators managing your entire organization, or one or more administrators managing the business unit or team you are a part of. Once you have identified a TreeFort administrator, they will be able to initiate the account creation process using their TreeFort account. More information on how an administrator can initiate the account creation process can be [found here](/docs/managing-your-organization/managing-users/).

### Completing Your ID Verification
Every user added to the TreeFort portal by an administrator at your organization must complete the same ID verification process that your clients will experience before the account can be created. Once an administrator at your organization initiates the account creation process, you will receive an email with a link to begin the ID verification process. You can find a full step-by-step walkthrough of the ID verification process you will have to complete [here](/docs/getting-started/the-id-verification-process/) under **The Client Experience.**

### Creating Your Account
Once you have completed the ID verification process, the administrator who initiated the account creation process will be notified that you have completed the ID verification process, and will be able to review the TreeFort ID verification report that was returned to them. After they have reviewed the report, they will have the option to approve you as a new user in the TreeFort portal. If you are approved, you will receive the following email from TreeFort to create your account:

Selecting the above link will direct you to the password creation page below.

![img alt](/img/password_reset.png)

You will need to enter your email address and the password you would like to use to log into your TreeFort account. Once you have entered the required information, select **Reset** to finish creating your TreeFort account. You will be directed to the login page below.

### Logging In

![img alt](/img/login.png)

To log into your TreeFort account, you will need the following information:

**Account Number** – this number was provided in the email with the link to create your TreeFort account. If you forgot your Account Number, you can follow the process outlined [here.](/docs/account-setup-and-management/forgot-account-number-or-password/)

**User Name** – this is the email address associated with your TreeFort account.

**Password** – this is the password you used when you first created your TreeFort account, or subsequently reset. If you forgot your password, you can follow the process outlined [here.](/docs/account-setup-and-management/forgot-account-number-or-password/)

Select **Remember My Login** if you trust the device you are accessing your TreeFort account from and would like to remain logged in for your next session.

### Two-Factor Authentication
If you are accessing your TreeFort account from a new web browser (or you have recently reset your cookies on your browser), you may be asked to go through a two-factor authentication process and will be directed to the page shown below.

![img alt](/img/two_factor_select.png)

You will be able to select how you want to receive your two-factor authentication code (i.e. via email or cell phone), and you can select **Send** to send the code. You will be directed to the following page, where you can enter the authentication code you received via email or cell phone.

Select **Remember this browser** if you trust the device you are accessing your TreeFort account from and would like to skip the two-factor authentication process the next time you access your TreeFort account from this browser. Finally, select **Verify** to validate the authentication code entered and log into your TreeFort account.
